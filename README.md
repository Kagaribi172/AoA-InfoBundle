### AoA InfoBundle ###
This mod is an addon to Advent of Ascension.

Currently, it only does three things:
* Adds dynamic DPS values to all AoA weapon tooltips
* Adds dynamic Energy/sec values all AoA Blasters
* Displays a HUD in the top left corner when using AoA weapons that shows the required ammo counts.

The aim of this mod is to add additional information to AoA that may not be suitable for the base mod.
It also serves as an example add-on mod for people looking to learn how to integrate with AoA

If you have suggestions for more information that can be displayed from this mod, raise an issue in the issues tab, or feel free to contribute yourself with a pull request, as this addon is open-source.
